I am a political economist at the University of South Carolina where I study broken political and economic institutions in the non-Western world. This website hosts papers, code and data from my [research](research/index.qmd) projects and also my blog, *Punk Rock Poli Sci,* that mixes poli sci (the politics of economic development) with a splash of punk rock (rethinking methods for scientific research in the 21st century).
