I am a political economist at the University of South Carolina where I study broken political and economic institutions in the non-Western world. This website hosts papers, code and data from my [research](research/index.qmd) projects and also my blog, *Punk Rock Poli Sci,* that mixes poli sci (the politics of economic development) with a splash of punk rock (rethinking methods for scientific research in the 21st century). You can find my [CV here](files/Robert_Kubinec_CV_full.pdf).

I am the author of two books:

[Making Democracy Safe for Business: Corporate Politics During the Arab Uprisings](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/making-democracy-safe-for-busines/B937C65E6766D9A5D8AC390EA2182B21)

[The Bayesian Hitman](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Hitman-Robert-M-Kubinec/dp/B0D6M4WNRZ)
