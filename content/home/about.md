I am a PhD Candidate in the Politics Department at the University of Virginia. My research explores the role of businesspeople during critical moments of countries undergoing transitions from dictatorship to democracy. During 2016, I undertook field research in Egypt and Tunisia, meeting with a range of businesses, parliamentarians, policy wonks, journalists, and civil society regarding the tumultuous political changes of the last five years.

This web site hosts information, data sets and code for my ongoing research projects in Middle East political economy.

I also incorporate advanced quantitative techniques in my analysis, including Bayesian modeling, time-series econometrics and psychometric measurement models. For more information about my projects using the R statistical software package, including the Shiny interactive data visualization framework, please visit my [Github site](http://www.github.com/saudiwin).

For a summary of my dissertation research, please view the presentation below that I gave as a finalist in the University of Virginia's 3-Minute Thesis competition:
