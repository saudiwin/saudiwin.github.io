# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research centers on political-economic issues such as corruption, economic development, and business-state relations in developing countries, and in particular the Middle East and North Africa. I am also involved in the development of Bayesian statistical models with Stan for hard-to-study subjects like corruption, polarization, and other latent social constructs.

My research explores issues in comparative and international political economy, particularly corruption, business-state relationships and entrepreneurship, and the development of Bayesian statistical tools for research purposes. To see a list of my current working papers and access the PDFs, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bhOaXR4AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) page. I am also the author of the [`ordbetareg`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ordbetareg/index.html), [`idealstan`](https://github.com/saudiwin/idealstan) and [`CoronaNetR`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/CoronaNetR/index.html) R packages, and a founding PI of the [CoronaNet COVID-19 policy project](https://www.coronanet-project.org/).

My book [**Making Democracy Safe for Business: Corporate Politics During the Arab Uprisings**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/making-democracy-safe-for-business/B937C65E6766D9A5D8AC390EA2182B21), shows why corruption among business elites and government officials proved so durable after popular revolutions overthrew authoritarian Arab governments. Based on original survey research and on-the-ground interviews on campaign finance, bribery and business relations with government agencies in Egypt and Tunisia, the book helps us understand why corruption is such a threat to emerging democracies, and what we might be able to do to protect new democracies these threats.

This website serves mainly as a blog in which I present ideas on political-economic topics I study and issues related to data science with R/Rstudio and causal inference. My R-related posts are syndicated with [RBloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), a consortium of R bloggers.
