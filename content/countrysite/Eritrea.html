<p>This is the country dashboard for Eritrea. It shows all the records for this country with update/correction links, and also a list of news sources relevant to the country pulled from our partner Jataware. Please use this website to go over all the policies and make sure they are up to date, and check the news sources to see if there are any new records/updates you need to make. When you are all done, coordinate with the people who are following the country to answer the survey in the email you received (only one person needs to fill out the survey per country). Please try to be as honest as you can in filling out the survey; it isn’t a problem if you are behind, we just need to know the status for every country.</p>

<p>Please note that if the date is missing, that means we currently do not have a record for that policy type for that country, and it would be great to check and make sure that one does not exist yet. In addition, for health resources there are a lot of possible options. We are especially interested in policies about masks, ventilators, PPE, and other crucial resources. For COVID-19 tests we have a separate category (Health Tests).</p>
<p>Please take some time to do some searches on those policy types for your countries and check other sources you have used such as government web pages.</p>
<p><strong>Remember too that we need to code the end/easing of policies as updates.</strong></p>
