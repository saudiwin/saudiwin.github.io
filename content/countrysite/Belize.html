<p>This is the country dashboard for Belize. It shows all the records for this country with update/correction links, and also a list of news sources relevant to the country pulled from our partner Jataware. Please use this website to go over all the policies and make sure they are up to date, and check the news sources to see if there are any new records/updates you need to make. When you are all done, coordinate with the people who are following the country to answer the survey in the email you received (only one person needs to fill out the survey per country). Please try to be as honest as you can in filling out the survey; it isn’t a problem if you are behind, we just need to know the status for every country.</p>

This means that only Belizean nationals, residents, and diplomats residing in Belize will be allowed entry into Belize subject to inspection and possible quarantine for 14 days. Similarly, the Northern Border will be closed for nationals and residents wishing to travel outside of Belize except for emergencies. The Philip S.W. Goldson International Airport will be closed effective Monday, March 23rd, after the last scheduled flight departs. Again, these measures only apply to the movement of people and do not apply to cargo trucks or cargo planes. (...) These restrictions will all be reviewed after 30 days.\"","In Belize, \"The Ministry of Human Development, Social Transformation and Poverty Alleviation advises the public that effective Saturday, March 21st, 2020 all daycares will suspend operations until Monday, April 20th, 2020 when schools are scheduled to reopen.\"","In Belize, \"Daily commuters are encouraged to take alternative buses in the morning and evening to avoid travel during rush hours. Employers are encouraged to be exible with working hours to accommodate their staff as this situation continues to evolve. (...) Public transport service is limited to seated passengers only. Bus operators/drivers shall not transport excess passengers. Transporting standing passengers is a trafc violation and the Department of Transport will enforce the law to its fullest.  (Anyone standing will be taken off the bus and the driver will be ticketed.) (...) The public is encouraged to plan ahead and consider travelling outside rush hours where possible in an effort to promote social distancing.\"\n","In Belize, \"  ALL transportation operators are required to clean and sanitize their buses, vans, boats, etc. before and after each run.\"","In Belize, \"Effective Friday, March 20, all schools will be closed for 14 days which will lead right into the Easter break. This is being done with a view to make up the school days within the current school year depending on how the situation evolves. It is stressed that this is not a vacation and parents and students alike must continue to follow the Government’s advisories for social distancing and vigilance with hand-washing and good hygiene.\"","In Belize, \"Effective immediately, social gatherings will be limited to 100 people. These include indoor and outdoor gatherings. Again, these numbers can be adjusted based on new developments.\"","\"Belize is taking stricter measures at the borders. At present, Belize is prohibiting entry into Belize by nationals of the following countries and persons who have traveled within the last 30 days from China, Hong Kong, Iran, Japan, South Korea, and Europe, including the United Kingdom. This restricted travel list of countries will be continuously monitored and updated as necessary. Today, it was agreed to close all ports of entry in Belize for passengers and only leave the Santa Elena Border (northern border) and the Philip Goldson International Airport open. So, all other ports of entries – the western, southern and any other small border points will be closed.  This does not apply to cargo vessels.\"\n"],["<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_af26bcoZHaxirTP&Q_R_DEL=1&record_id=1400129&link_type=C\" target=\"_blank\">Correct<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_1eXMgws83HHLT7G&Q_R_DEL=1&record_id=6348185&link_type=C\" target=\"_blank\">Correct<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_22tRVVEbMBQ38y5&Q_R_DEL=1&record_id=9275383&link_type=C\" target=\"_blank\">Correct<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_2dmxEALxGXC8yao&Q_R_DEL=1&record_id=6958082&link_type=C\" target=\"_blank\">Correct<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_5gyn4GOck2BKTwR&Q_R_DEL=1&record_id=1844005&link_type=C\" target=\"_blank\">Correct<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_9NX3VDbVVnX7Eit&Q_R_DEL=1&record_id=9955609&link_type=C\" target=\"_blank\">Correct<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_BDsFO84pjrbtwSR&Q_R_DEL=1&record_id=621095&link_type=C\" target=\"_blank\">Correct<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_sLQ2CDzNscp2hzP&Q_R_DEL=1&record_id=1100617&link_type=C\" target=\"_blank\">Correct<\/a>"],["<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_af26bcoZHaxirTP&record_id=1400129&link_type=U\" target=\"_blank\">Update<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_1eXMgws83HHLT7G&record_id=6348185&link_type=U\" target=\"_blank\">Update<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_22tRVVEbMBQ38y5&record_id=9275383&link_type=U\" target=\"_blank\">Update<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_2dmxEALxGXC8yao&record_id=6958082&link_type=U\" target=\"_blank\">Update<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_5gyn4GOck2BKTwR&record_id=1844005&link_type=U\" target=\"_blank\">Update<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_9NX3VDbVVnX7Eit&record_id=9955609&link_type=U\" target=\"_blank\">Update<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_BDsFO84pjrbtwSR&record_id=621095&link_type=U\" target=\"_blank\">Update<\/a>","<a href=\"https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=R_sLQ2CDzNscp2hzP&record_id=1100617&link_type=U\" target=\"_blank\">Update<\/a>"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>record_id<\/th>\n      <th>RecordedDate<\/th>\n      <th>date_announced<\/th>\n      <th>init_country<\/th>\n      <th>init_country_level<\/th>\n      <th>entry_type<\/th>\n      <th>type<\/th>\n      <th>event_description<\/th>\n      <th>Correct<\/th>\n      <th>Update<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"language":{"search":"Filter:"},"initComplete":"function(settings, json) {\n$(this.api().table().container()).css({'font-size': '9pt'});\n}","columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":["options.initComplete"],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

<p>Please note that if the date is missing, that means we currently do not have a record for that policy type for that country, and it would be great to check and make sure that one does not exist yet. In addition, for health resources there are a lot of possible options. We are especially interested in policies about masks, ventilators, PPE, and other crucial resources. For COVID-19 tests we have a separate category (Health Tests).</p>
<p>Please take some time to do some searches on those policy types for your countries and check other sources you have used such as government web pages.</p>
<p><strong>Remember too that we need to code the end/easing of policies as updates.</strong></p>
