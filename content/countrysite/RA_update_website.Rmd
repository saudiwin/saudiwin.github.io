This is the country dashboard for `r params$country`. It shows all the records for this country with update/correction links, and also a list of news sources relevant to the country pulled from our partner Jataware. Please use this website to go over all the policies and make sure they are up to date, and check the news sources to see if there are any new records/updates you need to make. When you are all done, coordinate with the people who are following the country to answer the survey in the email you received (only one person needs to fill out the survey per country). Please try to be as honest as you can in filling out the survey; it isn't a problem if you are behind, we just need to know the status for every country.

# List of Records

First, here is a list of all the records you have submitted to date, along with links if you want to correct or update any of them . *Scroll down to see all the entries*.

```{r ra_table}

font.size <- "9pt"

qdata %>% 
  filter(init_country==params$country,Progress>98) %>% 
  mutate(entry_type=recode(entry_type,`1`="New Entry",
                           `Correction`="Correction to Existing Entry (type in Record ID in text box)",
                           `Update on Existing Entry for record ID ${e://Field/record_id} (<- if no record ID listed, type in Record ID in text box)`="Update",
                           `Correction to Existing Entry for record ID ${e://Field/record_id} (<- if no record ID listed, type in Record ID in text box)`="Correction"),
         Correct=paste0('<a href="https://tummgmt.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bf6YMWbTpYJAW4l?Q_R=',ResponseId,

# List of News Sources

Below is a table showing you all of the recent news sources from Jataware, our machine learning partner, related to the countries you have done research on thus far. *Scroll down to see all the entries*.

#                                                              "Nauru",
#                                                              "European Union",
#                                                              "Andorra",

over_countries <- lapply(country_merge$init_country, function(c) {

  readRDS(paste0("../../data/CoronaNet/RA/jat_",c,".rds")) %>% 
    mutate(url=paste0('<a href="',url,'" target="_blank">','Link','</a>'),
           publish_date=as.character(as_date(publish_date)),
           policy=as.character(unlist(policy)))
}) %>% bind_rows

if(nrow(over_countries)>0) {
  over_countries %>% 
  select(-text,-policy) %>% 
  mutate(date_added=as_date(mdy_hms(date_added))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(date_added)) %>% 
  DT::datatable(escape=c(1:2,4:6),rownames = F)
  # knitr::kable(.,escape=F) %>% 
  # kable_styling(font_size = 10) %>% 
  # scroll_box(height="500px")
} else {
  print("Sorry, at present we do not have any news reports for your countries.")
}



```

# Policy Categories

What we also want to know is whether any categories are missing for `r params$country`. The following table shows the most recent policies announced for each of the categories for `r params$country` and for the different levels (national, sub-national, etc). We do not have individual names of provinces or cities, in this table, just the most recent for all provinces or all cities. *Scroll down to see all entries.*


```{r policycat}

ra_countries <-params$country
ra_countries <- ra_countries[!is.na(ra_countries)]

qdata %>% select(init_country,init_country_level,type,date_announced,ra_name,record_id) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  complete(init_country,type,init_country_level) %>% 
  filter(init_country %in% ra_countries) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  select(-ra_name) %>% 
  group_by(init_country, type) %>% 
  arrange(desc(date_announced)) %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  arrange(init_country,date_announced) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(type)) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = F)
  # knitr::kable(.) %>% 
  # kable_styling(font_size = 10) %>% 
  # scroll_box(height="500px")

```

Please note that if the date is missing, that means we currently do not have a record for that policy type for that country, and it would be great to check and make sure that one does not exist yet. In addition, for health resources there are a lot of possible options. We are especially interested in policies about masks, ventilators, PPE, and other crucial resources. For COVID-19 tests we have a separate category (Health Tests).

Please take some time to do some searches on those policy types for your countries and check other sources you have used such as government web pages. 

**Remember too that we need to code the end/easing of policies as updates.**

# Take the Survey

When you have tackled these tasks and believe your country is up to date, please fill out the survey below so we know. Note that only one of you should fill out the survey (you will also receive it via email).
