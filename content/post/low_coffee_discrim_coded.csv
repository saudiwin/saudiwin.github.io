It's good coffee. It has a slight after-taste of flowers or sweetness, but it's otherwise an interesting medium blend of coffee. The package is a little hard to open (requires scissors), but the coffee itself tastes pretty decent.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a medium roast. `Well worth the money."

I don't like any flavored coffees, iced coffees, or even much of the frilly expressos and cappaccinos.  I simply like a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />I liked the Melitta coffee okay but I'm truthfully not convinced it is worth its price.  Don't get me wrong, I consumed the whole bag; I am just unsure it is something I will purchase again.  It had the nice, strong taste of shade-grown coffee beans which I liked but I wouldn't say I loved.  I'm not sure it is any better than some of the specialties you can purchase in your local grocery (I'm not talking Folgers and Maxwell House here, but the other shade-grown coffees).<br /><br />If this product comes up in a good sale, I might be tempted to purchase it for a special occasion but otherwise, I probably won't be buying again."

This particular coffee is ground finely enough to be used in an espresso machine, but works just as well in a drip coffee maker.  I really like this coffee because I love the taste of strong, rich, and aromatic coffee, but I do not like when it is so strong and dark that it tastes bitter.  Melitta Cafe Collection Classique fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />My husband, who is also a coffee drinker, but doesn't quite appreciate it the way I do, only drinks coffee from a drip machine and has to make it very light and very sweet.  He is notorious for using the flavored coffee creamers.  When he he drank this coffee, prepared the same way he prepares his regular Folgers brand coffee, he didn't notice a difference and had no idea that I had let him try a new type of coffee.  So with that being said, if you're a regular supermarket brand coffee drinker who has to mask the flavor of coffee with sugar or flavored creamers, then I recommend not spending the extra money on this coffee as you probably won't notice a difference.  On the other hand, if you are like me, and truly appreciate coffee (I don't use sugar and use minimal creamer) then do yourself a favor and try it!"

I was expecting a grocery-store quality coffee, but it far surpasses anything I've purchased at my local supermarket and, interestingly enough, I like it better than most beans I've purchased at specialty coffee shops.  Here's why:<br /><br />It's got a bold flavor akin to Kenyan beans but has a rich, full, smooth (almost chocolatey) texture like Sumatra.  As if combining the best bits of my favorite coffee regions wasn't enough, it's a very low acidity coffee, almost completely lacking that bitter / burnt aftertaste that plagues so many dark blends.  It's not a ""bright"" coffee like those grown in Latin America.  I believe this blend of coffee would be absolutely PERFECT FOR DESSERT SERVICE, but shouldn't necessarily be limited there.<br /><br />I've brewed a few pots at work to rave reviews.  Even the barely-colored-water-that-she-calls-coffee gal shrugged and said it was good.  I'm not inclined to drink my coffee black, but this blend is smooth enough to be palatable, even for me.  In fact, I surprised myself by enjoying my first 10oz cup with no creams or sweetener.  Pretty remarkable stuff.<br /><br />At its current price point, it'll end up being a bit more expensive but of far better overall quality than your average grocery store, but may be comparable (or even cheaper) than your local coffee shop.

I tested a medium roast from Melitta and found it to have a pleasant smooth flavor and was very nice to drink.  It was not bitter at all.  I tried it both black and with sugar and cream and enjoyed it both times.  I generally do not drink black coffee but this brand was pleasant when served black.

This coffee is a pleasure from just opening the bag.  The aroma of just the beans is beautiful.  And when you go to make the coffee you will probably do the same as me and go to measure the amount equal to the water amount the same as when you make your standard coffee.  But you may have to toy with the measurement of coffee per ounces of water to be able to fully appreciate this coffee.  It was nice to have this coffee that is part of a specialty collection meet up to my expectations.

I drink my coffee black, and I love the varieties from Starbucks, Seattle's Best, Gevalia, Arriba!.  So when I had the opportunity to try this new coffee from Melitta, I was eager to see what they had to offer.<br /><br />My setup is a Gevalia 12 cup coffee maker using Melitta No. 4 unbleached cone filters.  For the trial, I brewed 6 cups of the Melitta the same way that I do my Starbucks - two rounded scoops using the Gevalia coffee scoop.  I was a little surprised at how light it came out, and it did not have a lot of flavor.  It definitely came out lighter than the other coffees that I have used - I have been getting satisfying results from my coffee maker and brands listed above using this method for 5 years.  For the next few pots that I made I used ""heaping"" scoops to try to get it stronger.  While it came out darker, I was disappointed in the overall flavor.  Since this is listed as a ""medium"" roast, I was looking for something on par with either either the Starbucks House or Peru Chanchamayo roasts.  This may be unfair since these are both Latin American beans, and I could not find anything about the origins of the Melitta Classique Supreme.  I found the flavor slightly earthy, but there just wasn't a lot that stood out.  I like coffees that are have citrus flavors or rich and nuttier.  Ultimately it is more of a lack of flavor that stuck with me.  It is unoffensive but underwhelming.<br /><br />If you are a current Starbucks or other coffeehouse drinker, you will likely find this somewhat disappointing.  If you are looking for a step up from Folgers you might like what you find.  As I think about a little harder, I would say that this compares favorably with Millstone coffee.

Like I said, my dad buys the good stuff.)<br /><br />Would I buy a bag of this product with my own money? Sure, if it was on sale in my local grocery store. It's a decent cup & I'm curious enough that I'd try some of the other flavors out there. Offhand though, I'd rather spend 8 to 12 dollars on a bag of the stuff at my bookstore job & drink that instead. Before buying bulk amounts of this coffee I'd recommend that any potential buyers purchase a bag at their local stores first.

(I received free samples for review of the Classique Supreme and the Hazlenut Creme Brulee.) And I am quite pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />My coffee of choice to date, which I've been drinking for around 2 decades, is Peet's (which I get shipped to me as there are no Peet's outlets near me). Peet's sells several varieties which I like, and I always buy whole beans and grind them to make a cup at a time via a cone filter. When making coffee for 2 or 3 people I make each cup separately (using 2 or 3 cone filters at once). Also, I never drink straight coffee but always sweeten it (usually with honey) and add half & half (and sometimes French Vanilla International Delight).<br /><br />Melitta's Classique Supreme, as well as the Hazelnut Creme Brulee in the same line (and I assume all the varieties in their Cafe Collection line) are ground ""Extra Fine,"" and look to me to be finely ground enough to be used in an espresso maker (though I only make espresso - which I use in homemade lattes - with unflavored dark roasted coffees and the Classique Supreme is a medium roast). It looks and feels too finely ground to be used in a French Press (which I occasionally use for preparing coffee made from freshly ground beans, ground relatively coarse).<br /><br />So for testing/sampling purposes, I've been preparing the Classique Supreme (which I've drank several cups of over a couple of days) in a filter cone, using the exact measurements I use when preparing ground Peet's beans. And once I have sweetened and creamed the coffee to my taste, I cannot detect a difference in quality. The only difference I have noticed is that both varieties of Melitta's Cafe Collection that I've sampled leave me with less of an intense caffeine buzz than I typically get from the same size cup of Peet's (whether it's a medium or dark roast variety of Peet's). That's not necessarily a bad thing, for sometimes my second cup of coffee of the day (I usually drink 2 TALL cups a day) leaves me feeling a bit over-caffeinated (e.g., headachey or just off-kilter).<br /><br />The bottom line is that I like this coffee and given the relatively low price (e.g., at Amazon as well as Melitta's website), I'm motivated to try other varieties in Melitta's Cafe Collection line (particularly their darker roasts).<br /><br />I had difficulty opening both 11 oz. sample bags of Melitta Cafe Collection coffee I received - I found it impossible to open either bag without tearing holes in the upper half of each bag - so I called Melitta to comment about this. The customer service representative I spoke with said that Melitta recommends using scissors along the top of the bag.<br /><br />*(The phrase ""cup of joe"" supposedly came into vogue after Secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson, Josephus Daniels, banned alcohol aboard navy vessels in 1914, leaving coffee the strongest drink on navy ships.)"

And after preparing two or more teaspoons, depending on one's preference, and hearing the coffee maker percolate and finally smelling the freshly made pot of coffee made and taking the first sip, one will experience Melitta as an alternative to other gourmet coffees.  With its mild and not as strong taste as a regular cup of Starbuck's, coffee drinkers familiar with Folgers' Gourmet Selections may find this brand as comparable.  Indeed, a coffee worth trying."

The coffee was darker and more opaque than normal, no doubt due to the finer grind.  The aroma was very rich and robust.  The taste is actually much better than I am used to - a rich, refined roast with a smooth mouthfeel.  I find it to be much better than Millstone and equivalents.<br /><br />After trying this coffee, I am placing an order for 3 more bags.  I definitely recommend trying a bag of this coffee!"

I can't say this Melitta Classic coffee makes me want to get out of bed per usual, but it has definitely been a perk over the last couple of days.  I drink a lot of coffee every day--usually a black classic roast of some sort.  And I have no shame in admitting that when I brew at home it is usually a mid priced coffee purchased at the Supermarket.  Its only when I am out that I get to partake in a more premium brand.<br /><br />I was delighted to find that Melitta's Classique is a medium brew ground super fine producing a rich and savory cup of coffee.  The balance of flavor is delicious and lends well to creamers. The only disappointment I encountered was the packaging.  I was very careful and still managed to end up with a floor full of grounds while initially opening the package. It arrived fresh, and I will definitely be making a purchase again."

Heck, I'll drink whatever dreck the greasy spoons are serving without complaining. At home, I'll even reheat a cup that's been sitting around all day, as horrid as that sounds. I totally eschew that dark, burnt-tasting, supposedly gourmet Starbucks (jokingly called Charbucks in our home) simply because it's far too strong for my tastes. But when it comes to my fresh cup of coffee in the morning - you know, the one that gets you going, the most important cup of coffee you'll drink all day - I like it to taste robust, hearty, sensual and strong.<br /><br />Coffee made in drip coffee makers always seems to lack this quality. Coffee from those popular machines always has a somewhat ""cardboardy"" flavor, in my opinion. So it was with some trepidation that I chose to receive Melitta's Cafe Collection Classique. When I actually do make drip coffee or perked coffee (for dinner guests and the like), I grind the beans fresh which helps both styles have that coffee shop flavor you can't seem to get any other way, unless you own an espresso machine or a french press, but I digress.<br /><br />Since this is already ground in the bag, I knew that my best bet would be to make it over-strong to help the situation out. I don't own a french press, an espresso maker or any other fancy coffee gadgetry. Instead, I made a single, large mug with 4 tablespoons of coffee grounds tucked in side a Melita coffee filter (stapled shut) and brewed for about 6 minutes on high in the microwave, much the same way I make coffee from Folger's coffee singles.  And it worked, the coffee smelled great, was a nice dark color and I looked forward to my first warm sip.<br /><br />And that's when I became disappointed. As dark as the color was, as rich as the aroma was, the flavor was...  lackluster. It simply didn't stand up to my cheap, easy Folgers singles. And that's a shame, because now I have almost an entire container of coffee to go through. And about that container...  It was almost impossible to open. The gold wire wrap that is supposed to keep the coffee closed later fell off immediately. It took a pair of scissors to open the bag and even then there was some trouble. Compared to simply tearing open a Folger's single, this put one more hassle in my morning that I didn't need.<br /><br />All in all, it was just OK coffee. For a premium roasted coffee brand, you'd think this would knock me out of my slippers but instead left me pining for something else. Coffee, anyone?"

About once a week or so in the evening when I'm in the kitchen cooking something else anyway, I partially cook up a pot of oats (I've always used McCanns, which is great, and I'm going to try some from the local health food store out of the bin -- I'll then decide whether to switch.)<br /><br />Anyway, 4 cups of water brought to a boil, 1 cup of oats added and simmered until the oats are just starting to get a little chewy, then turn off the heat and let it sit to cool.  Some extra cooking and softening will take place while it is cooling, but you want to leave them pretty chewy.  Then, into a sealed plasticware container in the fridge.  The amount of tending that is needed is minimal during this process -- just occasional stirring to keep it from sticking until the heat is turned off.<br /><br />Each morning, I scoop out what I want (for me, 2/3 of a cup), add a little water, stir it up, and microwave for just under a minute and a half.  Sprinkle on some cinnamon and freshly cut up fruit and raw slivered nuts. and you have about as healthy a breakfast item as you could want --  no more than a 2-3 minutes of morning prep time.  High fiber, complex carbs, no gluten, low calorie, and it stays with you all morning.<br /><br />Once you get into this routine, you'll wonder why you ever touched instant or quick oatmeal, or any rolled oats for that matter.  You'll learn to adjust how long you want the initial cook to be, how much water to add before microwaving, and how long to microwave depending on how soft you want the final bowl of oats to be, depending on your personal taste.  I feel more satisfied with a chewy oatmeal and think it tastes better a little undercooked, but to each his own.<br /><br />Only downside preventing 5 stars?  McCann's is a bit expensive compared to bulk steel-cut oats that is available to many, but a can goes a long ways, and is certainly cheap compared to most unhealthy ""quick"" breakfast foods.  Compare for yourself with what is in the bins at your local organic stores and decide for yourself if the extra price is worth it, but if you haven't eaten steel cut oats yet you owe it to yourself to try it.  Also, I've lived places where McCann's was the only steel-cut oats that could be found at the local grocer, so in a choice between McCanns and a cereal other than steel cut oats,  -- spend the money.<br /><br />This is basically the only grain I eat.  Another caveat -- I've never bought it through Amazon, but I would imagine that the quality is going to be very uniform for this product regardless of source."

I also don't have time to cook oatmeal every morning for at least 30 minutes, so I guess you could say that I don't have time for these oats.  If you have the time and like oatmeal to begin with, you may like these.  If you don't like oatmeal and don't have a bunch of time to spend cooking these, then I wouldn't suggest buying them.

But if Amazon offers another amazing deal on it, I won't hesitate to stock up (and get ONLY the long cooking version this time)!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product and will be pestering my mom and sisters to get some too.

It can take about 35 minutes to cook them from start to finish, with lots of stirring of the pot and keeping track of exactly how the heat is regulated on your stove.  I have made them the ""long"" way many times.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and the texture is quite pleasing.  I have also soaked the oats in water overnight and then cooked them the next morning which reduces the cooking time to about 10 minutes for me.  Still the same wonderful taste, but this method loses quite a lot of the whole grain sensation in the mouth.<br /><br />I was in the market for a rice cooker and while investigating them I noticed that some have a setting for porridge.  When I made my choice of the Panasonic SR-DE103 rice cooker it was partially because I wanted to use it to cook these oats.  The only drawback is that the rice cooker will only cook two servings at a time because the oats foam and bubble up so much during cooking.  Any more than two servings and they will be bubbling out of the steam vent of the cooker!  It also takes one hour to cook those two servings, but I can be off doing other things while the cooker takes care of the oats.  The oats cooked in the rice cooker have the same taste and texture as those cooked for the 35 minute method on the stove.<br /><br />This product is delightful.  I do add a tiny pinch of salt during the cooking time.  They are wonderful with either white sugar, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, butter, or just completely unadorned.  And, which is very important, a serving of these steel cut oats stick with me and I don't find myself wanting to eat a second breakfast two hours later.  One serving lasts until lunch time and beyond (if I'm really busy).  Any leftovers also keep well in a bowl in the refrigerator and warm up nicely in the microwave.

(Cincinnati is a very German city, originally called ""Porkopolis"" for the numerous slaughterhouses and sausage-makers located there.) Goetta is a sort of loaf-type scrapple, utilizing sausage, ground beef and other meats for a base. Some pals of mine often make it up, using organ meat from deer that they harvest.<br /><br />I cannot assert that goetta is a huge favorite of mine but I occasionally imbibe in the sausage-type which is okay. It takes a great deal of time and trouble to make but when it's finished, you cut slices from a loaf of goetta, fry them in a bit of cooking oil or in a great knob of melted butter, and then pour pancake syrup over it, or, if you're a Hillbilly like me, good sorghum molasses. Most generally, I serve it alongside eggs-over-medium or with scrambled eggs. This dish has somehow become a big item in deer hunting camps and I know guys who will eat it three times a day during hunting excursions.<br /><br />Goetta has a long cooking time which is why regular rolled oats won't work in the recipe.

The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****"

You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch.

I eventually decided on this tea, and I'm very happy with it. It's very smooth and has great flavor that's not dominated or overpowered by the ginger or lemongrass. I also agree with the previous reviewer that this works wonders for an upset stomach. The price is also very fair, given the high cost of quality loose leaf teas."

It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.

Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea ""leaves"" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.

Also try in your hair as a conditioner, hot oil treatment or sealant also cuticles. I am an african american woman with natural 4a hair. I can't say enough about this.

However, after months of using it I got where I couldn't stand to drink it any more (I used it by adding it to hot water or tea, as I didn't like it changing the flavor of my foods by putting it in them). Also, after months of using it the odor of coconuts was coming through my skin. I have noticed this with other foods too so it isn`t just the CO: say if I eat raw onions for awhile - or use apple cider vinegar every day - their odor will begin to come through my skin. The odor wasn't such a big deal, but I just hated drinking it any more. And, then when my cholesterol levels went up instead of down, I just quit it. And, over a period of time after stopping it my cholesterol levels came back down. But, then I went back to the sweets and it has again gone high. And, I have gained a lot of weight by eating all those sweets. So, I am going back to EVCO to help me lose some weight and keep off of the sweets. I have been taking in Organic Apple Cider Vinegar regularly - as well as Cayenne Pepper, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols - so maybe that will help keep my cholesterol levels from going high from the EVCO. Hope so...<br /><br />Oh, ironically, before starting the CO so long ago my favorite candy bar was `Mounds'. I totally loved the taste of coconut! But, after doing the CO I got where I almost could gag on it, and it took me a couple of years before I ever ate another `Mounds' bar. I was just totally coconut'd out!<br /><br />Now I will once again be drinking it, but will also use it to replace the omega 6 oil in my oatmeal bran muffins. Maybe I will also experiment this time with using it on vegetables.<br /><br />Even though I quit drinking it I have continued to use it for other purposes:<br /><br />* I use it in the summers as a mosquito repellant. It actually repels mosquitoes (more than) twice as long as 'OFF' (without the chemicals). And, does a more effective job at keeping them away. With 'OFF' some will buzz around, me; not so with CO.<br />* Also, before I go out into the garden I put some under my fingernails, and then dirt doesn't stick under my nails. And, cleanup is a snap.<br />* I have been using it the last few weeks to put in my nose so the CPAP air doesn't dry me out so much, and it is working wonderfully for that. When I first put it in I don't like the smell, but get used to it after the CPAP has run awhile. But, when I pull the CPAP mask off in the mornings the first thing I smell is coconut. But, it is much cheaper and more effective than the gel I was buying for that purpose. The gel was drying up and creating a thick paste up in there, but the CO keeps everything smooth gliding, and it also kills off bacteria etc.<br />* I tried it on my face for awhile, but it caused my acne to flair pretty bad. But, it does wonders for my skin on my legs.<br /><br />I really am hoping that this time I will be able to stick with it, without getting to hating the flavor and odor of coconut again, and hope it doesn't raise my cholesterol levels again: being this time I will be also be using Apple Cider Vinegar, Cayenne, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols to keep my cholesterol levels down. And, the CO can just be a nice `accompaniment` to those things."

IT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!!! it moisturizes like no other. i use it on my hair as a light deep conditioner. i put it on my hair before i wash my hair.like a hot oil treatment. i just let it marinate in my scalp and stuff. and then i wash my hair. it leaves it soooo soft and it even detangles!!! and it leaves my hair feeling strong and it is growing. but be careful if u use too much on ur hair it will become very very greasy and heavy. u only need a tad. okay next, i use it on my skin! i wash my face and i put it on my face afterwards. it leaves my face feeling extremely soft, clean and moisturized. also, it doesnt clog my pores. and once or twice a week i will do a soothing bath with the coconut oil. a warm bath mixed with the oil, is sooooo heavenly. Lol. Also use it when i shower too. it leaves my skin feeling soo soft. like i have eczema and it doesnt irritate it at all. my skin loves this stuff. it melts fast and the smell will takes some getting used to. i havent tried cooking with it yet because i really just wanted to use it on my skin cause i have extremely sensitive skin and eczema and i needed something pure and organic. and honestly, i can see my skin clearing up. my eczema is less itchy and actually looks better and is under control. coconut oil is so vital to my everyday skin care regimen. best thing ever."

The health benefits are enormous. This particular version is great because the large, wide mouth container makes it easier to scoop out the desired amount. Coconut oil is solid at room temperature so, unlike olive oil or other oils that are liquid at room temperature, you can't just poor it out. Light coconut flavor and delicious coconut smell. This is the best way to get your coconut oil, in our opinion and it is a great price. Coconut oil isn't the cheapest oil available in the grocery store but it is certainly one of the best for you and being able to purchase it in large quantities for a great price is so helpful."

Be sure to read up on the benefits of raw coconut oil, and remember, never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat. I'm actually a raw vegan, so this is a big staple for me. I love massaging sea salt and coconut oil into raw kale salad. Add ginger, cayenne, a bit of tamari, and a squeeze of lemon. Healthy and delicious! If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil. Coconut has a much higher tolerance for heat before it becomes harmful to the body. It's way more tasty than butter or any kind of butter substitute too. This coconut oil is raw. It smells amazing and is super healthy. I use it for everything, from salad dressing to raw vegan deserts, to stir fry, skin moisturizer, hair finisher, massage oil, etc. It's amazing on baked yams. If you eat toast, try mixing raw coconut oil with honey and using it as a spread."

I like it better than all other coconut oils.  Of course it tastes like coconut.  I don't want to use oils that are so overly processed and refined that they taste like ""nothing"".  I don't understand why the coconut flavor bothers some people.  If you don't like coconut, find a different oil.<br /><br />You can use this for grilling, frying, baking, sauteeing, greasing & flouring a cake pan, and all other places that you'd use butter or a Crisco-type product.  Just be careful on the baking because this melts at a low temperature.<br /><br />It is amazing as a skin softener, a hair conditioner, a leave in hot oil treatment, make-up remover, eyelash conditioner/glosser, shaving ""cream"", lip softener, cuticle oil, nail conditioner, bath oil, after bath oil, massage oil (add a few drops of essential oil if you wish), etc.  Speaking of massage oil, this is an excellent product for ""adult activities"" . . . as a perk it is definitely edible.<br /><br />If you have dry feet, slather this on, rub it in, wrap your feet with plastic wrap, cover with socks, and go to bed.  In the morning your feet will feel nice and soft.<br /><br />This can be used on leather such as shoes, jackets, and purses.  Because it's clear, you can use it on leather products that have decorative stitching that you can't cover with regular colored polish.  (In fact, I just bent over and put coconut oil on my black leather shoes with my fingers . . . the only clean up needed was to rub my hands together.)<br /><br />I've even used it on my wood furniture to obtain the same results as furniture oils.  I have used it to grease hinges and mechanical parts.  I have heard that you can use it to add lustre to pearls but I'm too chicken to try it on my good stuff.<br /><br />I know people that have used it as a laxative (in large quantities) and a diet aid.

I rubbed it between my hands then apllied to my skin and it smelled heavenly.  It smells like a creamy coconut.  I love it!  I just wish it would smell that way before it melts, but I love it!  My hair is so soft, my scalp is nice and dandruff free and my skin is soft and supple...not to mention smells so great!"

It's well blended and smooth, and the flavor is the best of all I've tried. I love it and use it for all kinds of cooking. It's especially good for cooking bitter greens like turnips or collards; the coconut taste helps cut the bitterness, giving a marvelous flavor to the greens.<br /><br />I've discovered a fantastic way to make healthy popcorn using VCO. I've tried the stovetop method in the past using olive oil, but it's always burned my pot. What I do now is put a great heaping tablespoon of VCO into my 10-quart Fagor canning pot, melt it at 390 on my induction burner, dump in popcorn kernels to just cover the bottom in a single layer, and put on a glass lid I have that fits the pot. Then I just follow through with the popping process, jiggling the pot a little to keep the unpopped kernels falling to the bottom as the kernels pop. I listen for the popping to slow, just like you do with microwave popcorn, and then just turn off the induction burner and let the pot sit a minute while the last few kernels pop. This makes a wonderfully VCO-coated popcorn that can be enjoyed without salt if necessary, or add just a little fine popcorn salt and toss."

About once a week I saturate my hair with this oil and leave it in for 15 minutes to 1 hour before I shower, then I shampoo 2-3 times so my hair's not greasy and do not need conditioner for a few days. I also apply the oil to my skin after I wash, but while still in the shower. Then I just lightly rinse the oil off with water only, after giving it a few minutes to soak in. This way my skin gets moisturized without that greasy residue that usually takes so long to soak in. Good for when you are headed to work and don't want that greasy look for an hour or so after application. Nutiva previously had a truly raw version of this oil, but just found out from their website the Nutiva folk's supplier of the raw oil could not keep up with demand so they had to remove it from their site!

I have noticed a correlation between stress and breakouts (and that familiar female response once a month) however I have not yet found a complete system which had worked to eliminate my acne.<br />After reading of coconut oil and Lauric acid, I have put it on trial... and have thus far experienced some impressive results..! It took about 8 days before I noticed the large cysts subsiding, and they have stayed away now for several weeks. Even my monthly cyst is keeping in check. Who would have thought rubbing your face with coconut oil twice and day and taking it internally would make the oily patches on your face actually improve? It seemed a little counter-intuitive, but so far I am experiencing some very clear skin... for the first time in years... Of course, I believe in coupling the outside assault with an internal one, so I have been taking the coconut oil daily (usually on bread or I just add it to cereal) as well as a wonderful greens mix (powder) and a pro-biotic. Of course, water is paramount, and I drink plenty every day, but I always did...

Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find ""packed on"" and ""best before"" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the ""best before"" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as ""organic."" Do a little research; ""cold-pressed,"" ""organic,"" AND ""hexane-free"" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar. Great deals can be found on Amazon, by the way, especially if you purchase the packs of two jars."

Instead, my review will focus on using Nutiva Organic Coocnut oil as a beautifying product.  I bought the 54-ounce jar for using on my hair and skin.  So here's what I think of it as part of a beauty/skincare/haircare regime.<br /><br />This is a fantastic product at a great price.  Sure, you could get a jar of coconut oil at the grocery store but it's quality wouldn't compare to Nutiva coconut oil which is food quality, organic, cold-pressed, and unrefined.  I was so excited when this product arrived that I tried it out immediately.  The first thing I noticed was the lovely smell.  The product smells good enough to eat straight out of the container and I admit I did taste a bit while applying it to my skin and hair.  My other observation is that it melts so easily in the hands and applies so well to both hair and skin.  My less expensive, refined Superdrug coconut oil cannot compare to Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil.  The cheaper coconut oils have hard, white bits in them and do not smell like actual coconut.  Nutiva is smooth/silky and melts easily in the hands without leaving behind white balls/clumps that the cheaper refined coconut oils have.  I love Nutiva so much that I emptied all my cheap Superdrug coconut oil into the rubbish bin and scooped some Nutiva Coconut oil into the little Superdrug canister and put it in my bathroom for easy access.  I am using Nutiva a few times a week on my body and hair.  Before bed, I scoop some Nutiva onto my hands and rub my hands together causing it to melt.  It melts quickly and I rub it onto my skin and hair (can be applied to wet, damp, or dry hair easily).  I saturate my hair with it and use a shower cap to do an overnight heavy oiling treatment.  In the morning I shower as normal and shampoo or condition it out using a clarifying conditioner.  This creates beautifully silky, shiny hair and skin! There are so many benefits to the body using this oil.  I highly recommend it and hope that it will always be sold on Amazon."

Nadeau,17,18,5,1236643200,Superior product!,"I have just recently begun using VCO for nearly all of my cooking.  After purchasing two books on the benefits of coconut oil, I have purchased several different brands of oil.  The Nutiva Organic EVCO is by far a superior oil with a delightful flavor.  The price from Amazon if you are a Prime member is the best I have found for this quality of oil.<br /><br />I began eating the oil mixed in about 1/2 cup of cottage cheese because I read on a forum that cottage cheese has properties which help the body assimilate the oil.  Since then I have expanded to many other uses.  I use the oil to sautee garlic, onions, peppers, etc for all of my soups and stir frys.  I spread it on toast and add it to my corn bread.<br /><br />In just the first week of eating coconut oil regularly I noticed that my chronic aches in my joints and muscles subsided.  My skin is smoother and blemishes began to disappear.  I began using it as a topical ointment on my hands, feet and face along with knees and elbows.  It is a much better skin conditioner than almost anything else I have used.<br /><br />I found that it also works great as a conditioner for all of my wooden cooking utensils and I rub it into my cutting boards to condition them.  It is far superior to mineral oil!<br /><br />I have introduced the oil into my husband's diet also.  He has been a Type II diabetic for about 15 years and just turned 77.  He is beginning to notice positive benefits also.  He particularly has noticed more mental acuity.  He adds the oil to his morning cereal and spreads it on his toast and really enjoys the flavor.<br /><br />I am so happy to have found this wonderful Nutiva oil and appreciate its many benefits.  I find it kind of addictive.  I now look forward to adding the oil to more and more foods and it seems to make nearly everything, including eggs, soups, stews, casseroles, muffins and breads more delicious.  I highly recommend the Nutiva brand of Organic EVCO for a huge variety of uses.  To those who think it has too much coconut flavor - well, I guess you can't please everyone.  Try it and decide for yourself.  The health benefits are worth it!  This oil has given me a new energy and improved my health so positively that I would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />The only downside I can mention is the plastic container.  It would be better if it were packaged in glass, but hopefully all those anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties of the oil will negate the use of a plastic container ;-)"

I use it on toast or bread as a snack and I feel full and satisfied for hours. And I have seen a lot less water retention all over....not so puffy.  Wish I could say I lost weight or inches, but no, I didn't.  I have heard of others losing as soon as they start switching to coconut oil.  When I bake with it instead of shortening or butter...everything is so moist...no coconut flavor added to anything either."

When I got back to my dorm it was already beginning to thicken up. I was also very happy to see that there was no spill. I got this coconut oil to use in my hair and I could not be happier. My hair is really soft and it seems like its melts away kinks and tangles that can come with hair 7 weeks post relaxer. My hair is super soft, moisturized, and shiny. I'm also seeing less breakage and shedding. At first I thought the oil smelled weird, but it's probably because I don't know what fresh coconut smells like. It smells spicy like pumpkin at first and then I smell coconut and I'm like ooooooh okay, that smells really good. I plan on buying a fresh coconut just so I can know what it smells like. It also feels great on my skin; it soaks in almost instantly and leaves my skins soft while feeling like I didn't put anything on at all. Before I did anything with it, I tasted it, to me it didn't taste like anything, it was only a little though. I'll probably still buy a separate jar for food purposes because of the health benefits.<br />All in all I'm extremely happy with this purchase and I will only buy this brand of coconut oil. I bought coconut oil from a natural diy/aromatherapy site that wasn't living up to the known benefits of coconut oil when used in your hair, it also wasn't unrefined and I think it is the cause of seborrheic dermatitis that I'm currently dealing with. But since I've stopped using that coconut oil that issue is just about nonexistent. So make sure what ever oil you are using is unrefined and organic!"

It sounds so douchey.  So... I've decided that would be the title of my review.  I think in general, coconuts are one of the most insanely useful nuts/fruits/things(?) found in nature.  Coconut water is extremely delicious (Amy & Brian's brand or C2O, the other brands can be meh), coconut milk is a great substitute for milk in certain non-dairy applications for all you hipster vegans, and Tom Hanks made a best buddy out of a whole coconut.<br /><br />Coconut oil, when it comes in the pressed extra virgin form, like with Nutiva or the other kinds you can purchase thru GNC, Vitamin World, etc. is also a miracle product.  It has a lot of applications.  It stays solid at room temperature which is pretty gnarly.  That's not a pro nor a con, just wanted to get that out there.  Knocking over an open container of this oil doesn't mean you have a mess to clean up, it just means your a klutz.  It's great for hair care, so say my black friends.  I have pretty thick hair so I don't really need it for that.  It's awesome for skin care too, like for acne scarring or minor skin blemishes.  It's completely anti-fungal and antibacterial so that means it's an all natural lubrication.  That last one was not something I have any personal experience with either, it's just something I wanted to type to make any readers still here uncomfortable.  But it's true according to many ""What to use coconut oil for"" websites.  It's also good to add as a means of healthy fat to a protein shake or vegetable concoction a la Joe Rogan Experience kale shakes in the morning.  Lastly, the real thing I use it for, is baking.  It's a substitute for butter at a ratio of 1:1, and a substitute for shortening at .75:1, meaning 3/4 cup of coconut oil is 1 cup of shortening.  Check this page out:<br />[...]<br /><br />The ChezUs recipe for banana bread is awesome.  Ok, I'm not writing any more stuff about coconut oil, don't be so goddamn lazy, go research (google) it on your own.  I was just supposed to write 20 words on this product but started my rant.  Buy it.  Or don't.  I don't really care what you do.  But if you do buy it, buy the 54 fl oz. jar like I did because it doesn't really spoil, more is better, and because I said so."

I originally first tried the stuff at Walmart, and it had no flavor to it at all, very bland.<br /><br />To combat some of the poor reviews I read on this oil, I think a lot of those are just due to people not doing their research before buying, and thus they're just being snippity pickeys.  Obviously since it has a coconut taste, you may not want to use it for all your cooking needs.  When I cook Italian foods, I use olive oil.  When making something like mayonaise, I use canola oil.  A little common sense doesn't hurt most folks.  (It tastes great on toast with a little cinnamon sprinkled on it.)<br /><br />As for it being hard as a rock....I haven't noticed that.  Scoops out very easily. But again, a little research, and you'll find that it is a solid until the temperature reaches approximately 76-78°F, then it turns liquid.  Thus, there shouldn't be much of an issue of ""melting it"" to cook something as one person stated.  Any other type of oil you usually  heat before you start cooking.<br /><br />It does work great as a lotion on your skin.  It actually absorbs into the skin, and after it's absorbed, it doesn't leave an oily residue like you'd think it would.  I would recommend doing it at night before bed, or if you have some time before going out or whatever, because it's not instantly absorbed.  And a little goes a long way.  Leaves skin very smooth.<br /><br />I've also started using this in my hair after I wash/condition it.  Again, it actually absorbs into the hair and doesn't appear oily.  I use it only on the middle to the ends.  I've noticed my hair is softer, very shiny, and it helps bring out my natural curls without looking as frizzy.  It also makes me long hair much easier to comb.  Obviously, use in moderation, again a little will go a long way, a light coating is all that's needed.  And, it washes out fairly easy.  If you use too much, you'll feel it, and just do a second shampoo rinse.<br /><br />My dogs also get a teaspoon every day, and look forward to it.<br /><br />For those that say they're going to stick to butter, so be it.  You already know that's bad for you.  And margarine...even worse.  I think it's high time people started looking back to the ""old days"" and other countries that don't have the health problems we do here in the ""industrialized"" world.  Not saying coconut oil is the savior, but I think it's a good start.<br /><br />Cheers!"

For health purposes, I also stir a teaspoonful into my coffee in the morning. Nutiva Coconut Extra-Virgin Oil works just fine. My only gripe: unlike with olive oils, as far as I know, there's no such thing as EXTRA virgin coconut oil. It's the same thing as virgin coconut oil. I suppose they label it that way for marketing purposes, but I never like to promote a myth. In any case, Nutiva works in every way that I expect it to, and buying the 54 ounce jar of Nutiva is the most economical way that I have found to buy it."

I started eating it myself - it has a very pleasant, mild taste - and I apply it to my hair and skin before a shower which makes even my hard feet smooth and soft without being greasy. It absorbs into the skin nicely. I thought the claims of a miracle product were merely the swoons of hippie health nuts but this product has enhanced my life and the life of my dog.

I was skeptical, to say the least. I'd heard all of the bad stuff about coconut oil, but I was curious enough to research. In the meantime, another acquaintance told me about a mutual friend who'd lost 75 lbs from using Nutiva. After that, I was more than curious--I wanted to try it.<br /><br />I'd tried a different brand of coconut oil before and was not impressed. It was very grainy and hard. Nutiva is very smooth. It's got a beautiful creamy texture and is very white. It also doesn't leave a smoky smell in my home--in fact, I love the way it smells when I'm sauteeing food.<br /><br />What sold me on this product was that I read you could eat it on toast. I thought that was weird, but decided to give it a try. The first time I tried it like that, I had meetings all day. I am ALWAYS hungry, and always snacking. I really eat about every 2 hours. Well, that day, about 5 hours had gone by before I realized I was hungry! I thought it was a fluke since I was so busy that day. A few days later, I tried it again. And once again, several hours went by and I wasn't a bit hungry.<br /><br />I am convinced there is something to weight loss with this product.

So my search lead me to Amazon for quantity, price and purity. I looked at many options here, and found this one. For me, the taste is a plus, but some might find it a problem. It has a fairly obvious coconut flavor to it, so if you are picky about flavors added to the food you are cooking, this could be a problem for you. I haven't found it to be a problem, myself. My wife won't cook with it because she is generally not looking to add a coconut flavor to most of what she adds oil to. I find that it is even a good flavor if I should occasionally choose to eat a tablespoon of oil directly. At room temperature, (at least during the winter) the oil is solid, and it melts in my mouth. It has a nice smooth texture, with that coconut taste. The color is nice white, like the inside of a coconut. It is supposed to be stable at higher temperatures. I believe it provides a good supply of the Omega-3 fatty acids, which I understand a lot of us may not get enough of. (We tend to get too much of the Omega-6.) I read of a low-carb recipe for chocolate lard, and thought it would work well with this coconut oil instead of lard. (Haven't tried it yet.) I heartily recommend this oil if you are looking for organic, pure, not hydrogenated coconut oil at a good price, (unless you don't want the coconut taste.)"

I was curious about it's potential benefits so I did more research. I was very surprised to learn how this oil had been the primary source of oil in the United States until there was a propagandist pitch against buying this oil due to conflicts of the world war at the time, as well as the increased interest in corn oil manufacturing in the U.S. Coconut oil became a target of U.S. corn and vegetable oil manufacturers. Today, it's nearly been forgotten or written off because of it's high saturated fat content.  Interesting to note that this oil's properties do not act like other saturated fats because it is a medium-chain triglyceride, which breaks down differently in the liver. After reading the information I gave it a go and I love it.  It is great for all sorts of cooking. It even blends well into a protein shake. It smells wonderful and works as a great skin conditioner and massage oil.  I would highly recommend coconut oil to everyone. Once you try it you won't want to go back to the unhealthy corn or vegetable oils."

I took several T. a day for 2-3 years but never lost weight, so I can't recommend it for that.<br /><br />To eat several T. daily, I made a concoction of chocolate melted with coconut oil and kept it in the fridge.  I found that I ate less sugar and chocolate that way--the coconut oil helped me feel satisfied with a little less chocolate. But, perhaps you can see why I wasn't losing weight . . .<br /><br />By making this coco/choc mixture, I was able to add fruit or ground flax seed (I'm allergic to nuts and this gave the choc/coconut oil a nutty flavor like a ganache) or wheat germ (a nutty-like crunch).  These additions helped me maintain a good glycemic index while eating so much candy.<br /><br />When I was using the coconut oil daily, my total cholesterol did rise but my ratio of HDL:LDL greatly improved.  I do believe that coconut oil is the best one to use, I'm just not much of an oil user.<br /><br />Perhaps if I had been substituting for something besides chocolate, I might have lost weight.  I was really adding oil to my diet instead of swapping.  But, even adding 3-4T. daily, I didn't gain weight, either, and I did get the improved cholesterol ratio.<br /><br />By God's grace, I stopped eating sugar in 2008. Now, I use coconut oil on weekends as my ""weekend treat"" in homemade popcorn.  (Not eating sugar really made me lose weight:  1#/week for 30 weeks, where I've remained for months.)<br /><br />This Nutiva jar is easy to open.  It's probably good to keep smaller amounts in another container to keep the big jar less contaminated . . . but I don't always do that.<br /><br />There was a slight coconut scent at first but that disappeared.  When I lick off the spoon when I make popcorn, I can taste a little bit of coconut, but not much.  I'd highly recommend this brand unless you really wanted that coconut scent.  the lack of scent does make it extremely versatile and much easier to substitute as a butter spread (hot vegetables, toast, etc.)"

It spoiled me completely. I've since tried two other brands and NOTHING tastes as fresh and light as this oil.  It has a nice coconut flavor and personally, I love the taste it gives fried eggs and even pancakes.  I also used it to make a pie crust (after chilling the oil slightly to compensate for the friction of working the pie crust) for a coconut cream pie and it was out of this world--flaky and delicious!!!  Like another poster, I also like it spread on a toasted English muffin and then topped with a light drizzle of honey.<br /><br />Our family has changed our eating habits in the last year and now we use only 3 fats:  1.  Coconut Oil 2.  Butter 3.  Extra Virgin Olive Oil (but only raw---never with heat!!!!--use the coconut oil or butter for fried & sauteed foods).

Not just coconut oil, but other virgen coconut products like milk and just plain coconut.  Ordered some probiotics and a detox tea called ""holy tea"".  Time to get the gut healthy!

Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it.<br /><br />You cannot ""eat it out of the jar"" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard.

I use it as a face moisturizer, to cook, bake, as a hair mask and soon I will be using it as nipple cream for breastfeeding and as baby bum cream. It's the one product I can't live without.

It's great added to a hot bath or used to oil the skin.  Terrific cure for tough feet in just a few applications.  It's definitely helped soften my facial skin and lessen the appearance of fine lines.<br /><br />This particular coconut oil is excellent - very smooth and free of graininess, it melts into a soft pure oil in your hands.  It has a very light, clean, coconut-butter scent - very pleasing.  It's a very large amount for the money and the best quality I've found of the half dozen brands I've tried over the years."

They arrived today, we opened them both and took our first taste of both. The Artisana brand we both agreed was kinda blah. The Nutiva brand we were both licking our lips because it tasted so much like a Almond joy candy bar. The coconut flavor is delicious!! If you want coconut oil without the coconut taste go for something like the Artisana or maybe another brand, but if your looking for the coconut flavor NUTIVA is the one!!! We will be buying more and will be buying the large size because we know for a fact we will be using this daily."

Being that I'm a male who's only 23, I have slowly wanted to switch to more healthy,organic products for my health and body as I recently did with my toothpaste,a fluoride free brand called Tom's of Maine. I decided to do the same with my lotions and hair care products. I did research of what products,organic,which can also be consumed,can best be used for these purposes,especially hair, and after reading about apple cider vinegar and virgin coconut oil I decided to go with the coconut oil because I can use it on my body as well,and man was it a great decision! The first noticeable thing about the coconut oil is the smell...DELICIOUS. I find myself just opening the top and having a whiff before I'll even use it sometimes. Also,the actual feel and convenience of the product is great. It's a great alternative to high fat butter products. It makes my skin feel smooth and my hair is always soft and my scalp dries nowhere near as horrible as it used to. Really,in this last month,I find it harder and harder to find dandruff present. When I'm out of the shower,I don't have to have 2 or 3 or 4 different bottles for conditioner then grease then lotion,etc. I have it all in this one container! I simply rub a bit in my hands to melt it,massage it through my hair and when I finish my hair,I move to my face and so on. It's great! It smells amazing,it's convenient,and it's healthy in terms of the fatty acids it contains which our bodies need. I know it's ""different strokes for different folks"",but I'd recommend this oil to anybody. If you use it for foods and personal hygiene like myself,I recommend the 54 oz. container. BTW,super fast shipping! I ordered on a Sunday morning,I had it Tuesday morning and was using it Tuesday night!"

Since I didn't know what brand to choose and didn't have any prior experience with coconut oil I decided to get one jar of the NUTIVA brand and one jar of the NATURE'S WAY brand.<br /><br />Here's my initial opinion of both: With my Nutiva jar there's a sticker indicating the expiration date and package/creation date of the actual oil, whereas with my Nature's Way jar there's nothing like that. When I opened both of them up to try and to just generally check them out I tasted a tiny amount of both and it was very clear that the Nutiva jar's coconut oil tasted much better. I'm not sure exactly why, but to me the Nature's Way coconut oil didn't taste as good, it was kind of toasty in a bad way.<br /><br />It was very easy for me to decide to use the Nutiva brand coconut oil for my cooking and in my smoothies and the Nature's Way coconut oil for my skin. I've since read that this difference in taste could be because the Nutiva brand coconut oil was fresher and the Nature's Way older. Or it could be quality, I'm really not sure. But I am sure that from now on I'm going to just be buying the Nutiva brand Coconut Oil (just ordered 2 more big jars of it). :)<br /><br />To say that the Nature's Way coconut oil was toasty still isn't exactly the right word -toasty sounds like something good... when it's so not, but I really can't think of a better word to describe the difference.<br /><br />I've found a lot of uses for coconut oil and have used it for many things with great results so far. It's hard to believe one little oil can do so much! Weird actually, but everything I've tried it with so far has had positive results.<br /><br />So here's a list of weird, random, but completely amazing things I've found coconut oil to do:<br /><br />-Works better than any make-up remover: seriously, just use a nickle size amount or less on your eyes to get all eye make-up off in a flash.<br /><br />-Helps clear up acne: One night after using it to take off my eye make-up I decided to use it as an all over face make-up remover... then decided my face felt so good I didn't want to use anything else (hint: leave the coconut oil on your face for a minute and then get your water and washcloth really really hot to wipe it all away). I googled to see if this was okay to do and it turns out coconut oil can help get rid of acne! You can use it as a facewash. Strange but true. BUT I also found out that Castor Oil works even better for this (and like coconut oil still moisturizes your face and keeps it from drying out), so I've ordered a small bottle of that to use instead in the future... but still, coconut oil has worked really well for me and apparently others. When you have skin like mine (I'm 25) that occassionally breaks out but still is a little dry sometimes it's hard finding the right balance and exactly the right thing to use -I feel like now I've figured out some great secret to getting it right.<br /><br />-You can use it as a deoderant: This one I read online and decided to try on a day where I wasn't really doing anything or working out. It felt weird -like I was putting some kind of lotion or body creme under my arms instead of my normal Secret deoderant. But guess what? It worked! I have since been trying it on days where I actually do work out and it STILL is working. Craziness! It keeps me dry and smelling good the same as my old deoderant did. AND there's no aluminum zirconium (have no idea how to spell that correctly) which I know is now supposedly bad for you (most deoderants still use it though) because it's connected/correlated with Alzheimers. So... an all natural, organic, one ingredient deoderant that feels like a body creme -doesn't get much better than that! Plus my underarms are looking softer/nicer. :)<br /><br />-You can use it on your scalp and hair: Now I've tried this several times and although I DO like the way it moisturizes my hair, I don't like the way my hair looks after I wash it out... it's just kind of lanky/heavy. Not in an extreme way or anything, but I like my hair to have lots of body. So while I do recommend coconut oil to help heal frazzled hair and stimulate hair growth I don't recommend doing it right before any big event in your life... maybe like a few days before so you get the benefit of the moisturized, healthy hair, without any worries about styling it. This is another one where I've looked it up and found that Castor Oil when massaged in the scalp can stimulate hair growth/fast hair growth even better -so now that I've got that bottle on the way to me from amazon I'll probably be using that instead, at least on my scalp.<br /><br />-You can use it as a body creme and even a BODY WASH. Yepp. A body WASH. Sounds crazy, but it makes my skin look SO good. Better than it's ever looked actually. Coconut oil has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties (and of course is moisturizing) and will clean your skin while hydrating it. So no harsh chemicals or detergents touch your skin -and if you have sensitive skin like I do, well this stuff might just be your new best friend, must-have, can't live without it ever, stuff! I used to have a minor skin problem on my arms that I absolutely hated. Just general redness, sensitivity, and tiny little red dots on the tops of my arms (that I've had since childhood). Now I absolutely don't -and it's literally all because of coconut oil. Maybe it's because I'm not putting soaps/bodywash on my skin anymore or maybe it's because coconut oil is really that awesome, but it has basically cured my arms and has made the skin all over my body look amazing! I seriously can't believe how good it makes my skin look! The best thing to do is to literally use it like a body wash all over -rinse off and then either just towel dry and go or towel dry and then reapply again if your skin is dry or it's winter or you live in a dry climate. When you reapply you're going to have to have some kind of small towel to wipe off excess with before you put on clothes. Either way it makes your skin look great. :) You can also use it to shave with apparently but I haven't tried that. I'm using it to make my own homemade body scrubs and of course using it as a body creme and loving it!<br /><br />-You can feed it to your dogs (one tablespoon a day) to make their coats shiny. (I've been giving it to both my dogs, although not every single day and they love it.<br /><br />-It can help you lose weight. Apparently it has a lot of really GOOD for you fats that your body doesn't treat like other fats and it actually helps you lose weight (learned this from Dr. Oz). Plus it tastes good when you cook with it and put it in smoothies. Actually I LOVE it in smoothies, it just adds an extra tropical coconut flavor. :-)<br /><br />-You can use it for Oil Pulling.<br /><br />-You can use it as a lip balm.<br /><br />Plus I know there's so much more but that's all I can think of right now! Basically it's really good stuff that I am now believing everyone should have in their home! :-)"

I use it for baking, stovetop cooking, and as a moistuizer for my skin (it works great, isn't real greasy, and it doesn't contain synthetic toxic ingredients like conventional lotions.) The 54 oz size is a great deal!  I can't wait till it's back in stock!"

Be sure to read up on the benefits of raw coconut oil, and remember, never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat. I'm actually a raw vegan, so this is a big staple for me. I love massaging sea salt and coconut oil into raw kale salad. Add ginger, cayenne, a bit of tamari, and a squeeze of lemon. Healthy and delicious! If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil. Coconut has a much higher tolerance for heat before it becomes harmful to the body. It's way more tasty than butter or any kind of butter substitute too."

The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****"

You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch.

Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea ""leaves"" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).  On a positive note, I will say that the steeped beverage does have a very nice yellowish green color.  Overall, though, I have to rate this tea at a not-very-good 2 stars out of 5.

I want to keep it a secret!<br /><br />My husband and I decided that if we are going to be drinking something everything morning for the next 50 years of our life, we want it to be organic.  Fair trade just happens to be another bonus.  Both coffee and sugar are the highest sprayed crops in the world.  Coffee especially so we first made the switch over this brand and tried this flavor first.  We grind it at home and brew it with an <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HBCVX0"">AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker with Bonus 350 Micro Filters</a>.  The combination of grinding it fresh every morning and brewing it with the aeropress makes for the best cup of morning coffee EVER.  We use a simple <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SPEU"">Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black</a> and simply grind it for 15-18 seconds.  We also switched sugars and now use organic and fair trade sugar as well along with locally bought raw milk.  The best sugar for this is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZIO"">Rapunzel Pure Organic Whole Cane Sugar, 24-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />YOU CANNOT GET THIS TREATMENT AT STARBUCK!<br /><br />It really does make for the best coffee in the world if you grind it right, brew it right and use wholesome ingredients.  My husband threw out his old coffee pot and went from being a die hard pot of Folgers a day to simply drinking four shots of this in the morning.  We both feel like we are drinking delicious coffee from Vienna every morning.  We tried this flavor first, but we are going to try the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L6OZRO"">Equal Exchange Coffee, Organic Colombian, Whole Bean,12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> next by the same brand.  We prefer light roasts instead of darker roasts like French.  Incidently, most people don't know this, but the lighter the roast - the more caffeine in it and in our opinion, the better the flavor.  Darker roasts seem to really kill the flavor of coffee and you run the risk of more oils and higher acid and bitter flavor.  I don't really know why people like dark roasts and I think it is more the sound of it than the actual flavor that they fall for.  We both discovered at one point that lighter roasts such as breakfast blends and Columbian has better flavor, more caffeine, less acid, etc and ever since stay away from darker roasts.  We might also try the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5WQI"">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Breakfast Blend, Ground, 12-Ounce Bag (Pack of 3)</a> at some point as well along with the decaf so we can enjoy an afternoon drink.  I notice this particular blend seems to have two colors of coffee beans in it, one is light and one is medium.  No darks which we love!<br /><br />This might seem like an elaborate set-up, but we actually came about all this after struggling for a couple of years drinking coffee and getting sick from it.  I finally discovered that I am sensitive to the acids in coffee.  This put me on a lot of research on coffee, the acids in it, how it is made and the best ways to grind and brew it.  Both my husband and I are fairly frugal but after reading that coffee is the worst sprayed crop in the world except for Christmas trees (ever notice how Christmas tree farms have nothing but dead ground around the trees.... yeah, exactly like that!), we made the decision to do this.  Also, I now can enjoy and drink coffee every morning without any abdominal pain.<br /><br />So remember, this coffee + good filtered water + fresh grind + aeropress + rapunzel sugar + raw milk = best coffee in world!<br /><br />Enjoy!"

I am really trying to stay out of Starbucks to save money; enter this very creamy and delicious mix from Ghirardelli.  It is such an inexpensive way to enjoy a white mocha!<br /><br />Ten reasons why this mix rocks:<br />1.  It contains no saturated fat or trans fats<br />2.  Each serving of mix has only 100 calories<br />3.  It contains the coffee and is good on its own, but I add powdered espresso or cold brew for AM kickstart<br />4.  I really like being able to control the milk fat content, it tastes really fresh and not like fake creamer<br />5.  It is good hot or cold<br />6.  This mix is ideal for keeping in your office<br />7.  It contains regular sugar and not high-fructose corn syrup<br />8.  One can lasts me four work weeks, but I don't have one everyday<br />9.  It is good to take camping/backpacking for a yummy hot pick-me-up while ""roughing it""<br />10.It is awesome with a shot of dark rum, khalua or other suited boozy add in -- instant winter lifter ;)<br /><br />ECONOMY: At 19 servings a can for $4 (21 cents/serving) + milk (25 cents/cup), each white mocha is less than 50 cents!<br /><br />EASE OF USE: It mixes instantly in hot liquid.  If making an iced drink, stir the powder into a small amount of hot liquid before adding the cold milk and ice or you will have the movie DUNE on top of your iced drink.<br /><br />TASTE: To me it tastes very much of white chocolate, it may be just flavoring but it really works.  Actual white chocolate doesn't have any cocoa in it, just the cocoa butter, so I didn't expect any chocolate in the ingredients list and was not disappointed to see it missing.  If this had actual chocolate in it, it would be a black & white (or tuxedo) mocha mix.  It is important to read all the details and ingredients of a product before ordering to avoid disappointment over assumptions.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Scrumptious and thrifty"

It contains 21mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee).<br /><br />Yogi Green Tea Super Anti-Oxidant makes me glad every day that I stopped drinking coffee and switched to teas---it's that good! If you've only tried commercial brands like Stash and Celestial Seasoning, and you think you don't like tea because they taste fake and full of strong flavorings, then you owe it to yourself to give this tea a try. If you enjoy Stash and Celestial Seasonings, love their strong flavors, and disagree with me, you may not like this tea as it is subtle and a very different tea-drinking experience. You'll know what type of tea drinker you are!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"

I can see many of the flavors are being reviewed under one product here.<br /><br />I enjoy tea but have always had a hard time making it part of a healthy routine. This tea has made me enjoy it so much that I now have my daily tea without fail.<br /><br />It has flowery notes like that from an Orange blossom for me this flavor is addicting along with the lemongrass. I just love how<br />the other herbs they add to the blend make it so much more flavorful than you average green tea. This method of blending<br />has been proven by science to be the most effective against both treating and preventing cancer as well. If you look up Cancer under TEDtalks website or youtube channel you can find video lectures on this subject. In short blending tea varieties as well as herbal blends have more of a health effect than a single tea variety or single plant variety.<br /><br />I have since branched into a few other flavors of Yogi teas... This one is my go to favorite but I enjoy the others too especially for variety.<br /><br />My mother is now loving this green tea as well I got her a 1 year supply of the green tea and Vanilla spice for Mothers Day. She loves<br />them both.

I think this green tea is one of the reasons as it has a lot of stuff in it that helps build up your immune system. I always mix a big spoonfull of honey in this and some goji berries. Very good!

Of tea.  Lots and lots of tea.  And this Super Antioxidant green tea from Yogi is my favorite, because it packs a powerful antioxidant punch in a pleasant tasting package.  I drink about 4 cups of this a day and then shift to a decaf version (Bigelow's decaf green tea) after 3 PM so I can continue to mop up those free radicals while still retaining the ability to sleep like a baby.<br /><br />Green tea has a lot going for it, healthwise.  Beyond the powerful antioxidant action, tea leaves contain a powerful amino acid called L-theanine, good for the soul--Google it to learn more.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy the taste of this tea (I sweeten mine with a packet of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3OE"">SweetLeaf All Natural Zero Calories SteviaPlus, 100 Packets, 3.5 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> ) & highly recommend it--it has a wonderful, full flavor and no bitterness (tip:  don't bring your water to the boiling point & don't steep for more than 3 to 3-1/2 minutes.  If you get your water too hot, you'll ruin the taste of ANY green tea!)."

I have all the green teas and after a month of testing them I conclude that Rejuvenation tastes the best. It has a natural peach and lemon flavor that is very natural and mild. Most say the Simply Green tastes the best but to me it was far too boring. I got used to all the special herbs and natural flavors and the Simply Green had none added. I do not like the artificial flavors at all, nor do I like the artificial sweet taste added by too much stevia leaf.<br /><br />The Super Anti-Oxidant variety of tea tastes good except for the licorice. The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas, but does not taste right in green tea. Other then the licorice it does have a very good lemon flavor that is soothing and mild. The Kombucha tea is also great which has a berry taste, that is good and natural passion fruit and plum, but I prefer the lemon flavor in my green tea. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor in it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas. I just love the Yogi tea positive messages don't you? At first I just bought these teas for the messages then I learned to love the tea as well! Rejuvenation is my favorite green tea and Peach Detox and Redbush Chai are my favorite flavored teas and make exceptionally good iced tea as well! The flavors, however, are very close and it took me quite a while to figure out which green tea I prefered the best. This one is good if you like licorice in your green tea that is.<br /><br />Wise quotes from Yogi Tea by Yogi Bhajan<br /><br />""The universe is the stage on which you dance, guided by your heart.""<br /><br />""The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment.""<br /><br />""Delight the world with compassion, kindness and grace.""<br /><br />""Laugh because that is your purpose in life.""<br /><br />Happiness is every human beings birthright.""<br /><br />""Be happy so long as breath is in you.""<br /><br />""Real happiness lies in that which never comes nor goes, but simply is.""<br /><br />""Travel light, live light, spread the light, be the light.""<br /><br />""Your greatness is not what you have, it's what you give.""<br /><br />""Practice kindness, mercy and forgiveness.""<br /><br />""Bliss cannot be disturbed by gain or loss.""<br /><br />""Compassion has no limit.

After trying one, the ingredient was undeniably there.  May not be a lot, but enough that I can actually taste it.  Should have checked the actual ingredients section because it's on there.  The product summary or product description didn't have it included however.  Moral of the story is: check the ingredients section before you buy any of these Yogi special green tea blend teas. If you don't like it, you're going to get stuck with a whole lot of boxes that you can't return.  Here is the message I found on the page where you would normally do amazon.com returns:<br /><br />""This item is not eligible for return. Please see our Returns Policy for more information.

The sweetness is no where near as powerful as the Egyptian licorice tea, but it is still there.  This sweetness is very similar to a very mild artificial sweetness seen in sugar free drinks.  If you are looking for a slightly sweet aftertaste, then this tea is certainly for you!"
