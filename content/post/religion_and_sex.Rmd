There has been plenty of discussion about declining fertility rates and patterns of marriage among people in the United States following the news that the [US birth rate declined to its lowest since the Great Depression](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/us/us-birthrate-falls-covid.html). There are a lot of debates about why this is the case, whether it be the expense of raising children, the lack of flexible options for women with careers, or a loss of societal values favoring larger families. Part of the backdrop of this demographic change, of course, are changes in how Americans identify themselves, particularly in terms of religion. For the last several decades, Americans have moved away from traditional religious categories like Christianity towards so-called unaffiliated status.

This matters for birth rates because it seems like people who do not have a religious identity are also noticeably less likely to [have children](https://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/north-america/). While doing some reading on this subject on my own, which I find fascinating--is there a connection between these changes in religious affiliation and child bearing?--I also wanted to see whether belonging to a religious group changes sexual frequency. In other words, does becoming more or less religious lead to more sexual activity overall? There are a plethora of studies about virtually every side of American sex lives, but surprisingly I couldn't answer this question from a review of studies (admittedly limited by my knowledge of the field and Google Scholar). As a result, in this post I'll set out to answer this basic descriptive question:

> Which religious groups have the highest rates of reported sexual activity?

To answer this question, I'll use data from the truly phenomenal [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/). As a social scientist who does most of my work outside of the developed West, I am perpetually amazed at the quality of data about the lives of people in wealthier countries, ranging from their sexual proclivities to wealth, income, and political partisanship. In the Middle East where I do the majority of my research, these types of studies are just becoming more prevalent, and collecting data on sexual activity is largely still taboo.

Digression aside, the rest of this post I will show the data processing steps to answer this question. The data are easily available from GSS' site linked above, and they even have a handy dandy R script to load the data (see this post's Rmarkdown file for details).
