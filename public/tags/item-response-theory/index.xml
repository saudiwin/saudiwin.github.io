      <description>Estimating legislator ideal points from roll-call voting data has become a powerful tool for understanding legislative behavior and polarization within legislatures over time. However, the dominant approaches in the field tend to ignore both absences and abstentions in roll-call votes even though it is very likely that absences and abstentions represent a form of strategic behavior. In emerging democracies like Tunisia, this lacuna is particularly problematic because legislator absence may occur very frequently, and resulting estimates that exclude absences are either very imprecise or significantly biased.</description>
