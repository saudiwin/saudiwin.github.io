      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my dissertation, I theorize that pro-authoritarian coalitions are more successful at undermining transitional democracies when elites who make up the coalition are strongly unified around the goal of regime change as opposed to lesser political aims. In Tunisia, where I undertook field research for eight months, I found that there are plenty of elites who pine for a return to the days of the dictator Ben Ali, and that these elites even went so far as to form a political party, Nidaa Tounes, that obtained the greatest numbers of seats in Tunisia&amp;rsquo;s parliament in 2014. However, this party has failed in many of its anti-democratic aims, such as passing legislation granting amnesty to corrupt businessmen from the prior regime. By contrast, in Egypt, a pro-authoritarian coalition led by the military has brought about a stable and increasingly repressive dictatorship that has stamped out all dissent. I argue that in Egypt, the economic influence of the military helped keep potential rivals, namely powerful businesspeople, strictly in-line with the military-led coalition, securing a stable transition to dictatorship. Tunisia, by contrast, lacks such an actor capable of preventing elites from squabbling with each other and undermining the success of the pro-authoritarian Nidaa Tounes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am testing hypotheses derived about business participation in elections from my field research through an online survey being fielded in Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia. The survey looks at whether firms that are more connected to the military and that depend on the government for various kinds of favors are also more likely to be involved in funding political parties. The survey uses Facebook as a targeting device to ensure that businesspeople are recruited into the online panel.&lt;/p&gt;
