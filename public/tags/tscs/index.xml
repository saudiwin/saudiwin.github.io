      <description>Abstract The two-way fixed effects (FE) model, an increasingly popular method for modeling time-series cross-section (TSCS) data, is substantively difficult to interpret because the model&amp;rsquo;s estimates are a complex amalgamation of variation in the over-time and cross-sectional effects. We demonstrate this complexity in the two-way FE estimate through mathematical exposition. As an illustration, we develop a novel simulation that enables us to generate TSCS data with varying over-time and cross-sectional effects and examine the behavior of the two-way FE model as these effects change.</description>
