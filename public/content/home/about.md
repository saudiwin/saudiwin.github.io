I am a PhD Candidate in the Politics Department at the University of Virginia. My research examines the influential role played by powerful businesspeople in emerging democracies. Through field research and surveys of businesspeople in North Africa, I show how businesspeople's engagement with emerging democracies is especially problematic when business is united against democracy. This outcome is much more likely to occur if a powerful state actor, such as the Egyptian military, is able to force businesspeople to work together to undermine democratization. You can access my CV from [this link](https://virginia.box.com/shared/static/yujb02uas3v721qtvru3xlh9bjo7oct1.pdf).

I also incorporate advanced quantitative techniques in my analysis, including Bayesian modeling, time-series econometrics and psychometric measurement models. For more information about my projects using the R statistical software package, including my forthcoming R package `idealstan`, please visit my [Github site](http://www.github.com/saudiwin).
