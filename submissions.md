We accept submissions from young Christians from all walks of life. ("Young" is interpreted very liberally.) We are looking for original work on policy and politics that is a blend of opinion and analysis. We also accept pieces that are descriptive rather than prescriptive, and even some satire. All submissions should be no longer than 1500 words (shorter is fine) and in Microsoft Word or Latex/Markdown.

Once we receive your submission, we will determine whether it was written in the spirit of what we want to include on this site, namely, political writing in a Biblical framework with substantive depth. We will reject pieces that have primarily polarizing language or inflammatory arguments. It is not a question of the topic: we will publish on literally anything. It is more how you approach what you write: you should be trying to appeal to our readers and persuade them of your view instead of triumphantly presenting your thoughts as superior.

Once we determine that your work meets our basic criteria, we will send it to three reviewers on our reviewer board. We will choose reviewers that have substantive expertise in your topic and that have different perspectives on your conclusion. For example, if you are defending the welfare state, we will send it to reviewers who have a negative view on welfare, and vice versa. We give our reviewers two weeks to review pieces.

Once you receive your review, we expect you to make edits to address their concerns. This does not mean you need to change your conclusion or bottom line, but rather that you must make thoughtful responses to the editors' points, even if you disagree with them (which you likely will). This may make your piece less punchy, but that is exactly the point.

We will give you another two weeks to make revisions. After then you can re-submit, and the general editors whether your revisions are enough. If they are, your piece will be accepted for publication.

This process is designed to bring us as Christians into dialogue with each other. We believe that our ideas and policies will improve as we learn to listen to each other's concerns with honesty and humility.
