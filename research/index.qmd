On this page you can see a list of my articles, books, and other published works (see table of contents on the left) along with associated code and datasets. You can view my [CV here](../files/Robert_Kubinec_CV_full.pdf). My research has focused on the following questions that span the political economy of development, data science, causal inference and Middle East politics:

-   How do businesses influence politics in countries with serious issues of corruption and regulatory mismanagement?

-   How do businesspeople become successful entrepreneurs in countries where personal and political relationships are necessary to grow their firm?

-   What are the prospects for democratization and political stability in the Middle East and North Africa?

-   How can scientists develop robust measures of concepts they care about and make credible causal inferences that take into account diverse forms of data and evidence?

Often these questions overlap, such as when I use new statistical tools I develop to study corruption in the MENA region and elsewhere. My R packages, [ordbetareg](../ordbetareg.qmd) and [idealstan](https://saudiwin.github.io/idealstan/), both came out of my research in studying online experiments and legislature behavior, and have also been used in other studies to date. I am both a skeptic of data science & AI and a developer of data-scientific methods because I see great promise *and* peril in quantification.
